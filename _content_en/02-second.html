<h2>Relevance</h2>

<p>
  The renewal of the tunnelâ€™s appearance will benefit the nearby infrastructure
  of these two neighborhoods. Give safety and comfort to the local residents,
  will have an impact to increasing the tourist numbers and provide the city
  with a new Street Art object that will be globally worldwide recognized.
</p>

<h2>What is this project about?</h2>

<p>
  My project is to renovate and refresh the tunnel space and to develop the
  fruitful collaboration with a Street Art artists from Czech Republic and all
  over Europe to paint the walls in. The paintings will extend the entire 303
  meters. It will be filled with around 150-200 artists, covered by themes such
  as freedom, peace and self-expression.
  In the first step is to proposed the tunnel to be painted by Czech artists,
  whose works will open the entire project.
  The first phase of work will be a demonstration of what it might look like.
  Working with artists, painting and presentation of the first exhibition. In
  the future there will be a possibility of monetisation by renting a space for
  their legal street art in the tunnel.

<h2>How it will work:</h2>

<p>
  One can send a request, a presentation and a motivation letter to the
  SSimonovArt Foundation. The submitted request is reviewed and approved by the
  Board. A contract would be signed with the artist, as fare as the positive
  decision regarding his candidacy would be made. The artist should pay the
  fee, got the lease, and can start working. That would be the way, the
  Exhibition will be update. and give an additional opportunity to organize
  exhibitions on different topics in cooperation with the National Gallery of
  Prague and other Galleries as well. Bright colors and proper lighting would
  help to change and transform the appearance, in order to make the urban
  environment comfortable and safe for visitors and locals who use the tunnel
  every day. At the moment the tunnel looks very uncomfortable, empty walls
  covered with white tiles that have not been changed for more than 50 years.
  Insufficient lighting, half of all the lamps are not lit at all.  All of that
  is creates an intimidating atmosphere.
