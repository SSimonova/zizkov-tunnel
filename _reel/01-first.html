<h2>What is this?<br />



<p3>The Žižkov Tunnel is located in the Hard of Prague and ties Karlin and Žižkov neighbourhoods, through Vitkov Hill. These districts are different from each other:  Karlin is a new, progressive residence with dozens of offices and brand companies, while Žižkov is a mostly dormitory residential area with many historical buildings.
The tunnel was built in 1953 and is 303 meters long, 4.4 meters wide and has a height difference of 29 meters. The tunnel was designed as a bunker in case of nuclear contamination, In addition to fulfilling its main pedestrian function, It was supposed to be able to hide about 1,200 citizens of Prague for 72 hours as well. Both entrances to the tunnel were to be closed with iron doors, but they were never built; the jambs and hinges can still be seen today.</p3>
<p>So Bunker=security, especially doesn’t work this way.</p>
