<p>Lake Street tunnel, is a road tunnel in Lambert, central London. Its history began before 1920, this place has always enjoyed a not very good reputation, from early morning the bars next to this tunnel were filled, different variations of cheap alcohol attracted people’s attention, the gloomy and chaotically painted place had a reputation for insanity. This was the case until 2008, when a well-known street artist, Benxi, carried out a renovation, he used the history and disadvantages of this place, changed them into pluses and opened a new space for self-expression. Now it is a 300-meter canvas for street art artists. More than 1 million tourists visit this place every year, as well as locals and tourists often like to arrange performances and photo shoots there.</p>
